This project was created with yarn create react-app to demonstrate React.memo() and useCallback().
This app is made for demonstrative purpose.
React.memo() and useCallback should be used to optimize application,
but only when it's reasonable to keep the data instead of re-evaluating it.
use yarn to install packages
use yarn start to start the server
